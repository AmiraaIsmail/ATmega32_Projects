# Distance Measurement

This project allows you to meesure the distance using ultrasonic sensor.


## Components used in this project:

(1) ATmega 32.

(2) LCD 20*2.

(3) Ultrasonic Sensor.


## Features of the project:

Automatically measuring the distance using ultrasonic sensor.


## Overview of the code:

First of all, The distance will be appeared on LCD 

Secondly, The distance on LCD will be updated according to the measured value.


## About the attached files:

(1) This code is implemented on Eclipse IDE. So, it is highly recommended to download it and begin using my code.

(2)A proteus simulation is also attached.
