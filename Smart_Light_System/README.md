This project allows you to adapt the room light accordingly using any LED.


## Components used in this project:

(1) ATmega32.

(2) LCD 40*2.

(3) Keypad 4*4.

(4) LDR.

(5) LED.


## Features of the project:

Automatically adapting the room light accordingly using LDR.


## Overview of the code:

- Set Threshold value for LDR using Keypad

- Read the LDR value using ADC channel 0.

- Display the percentage of light on the LCD.

- If the light above the threshold so adapt the room light accordingly using any LED.



## About the attached files:

(1) This code is implemented on Eclipse IDE. So, it is highly recommended to download it and begin using my code.

(2)A proteus simulation is also attached.
